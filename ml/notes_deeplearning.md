# machine learning 
    - supervised:
        - we teach the machine what to do 

    - unsupervided:
        - the macheine gets the pattern by itself 

## supervised
    -  regression
        - fit the data 
        - we expect the value of the house according to the size of the house
        - output is contououse values 

    - classification
        - output is catogorize 
        - output is limit number of results 
        - we expect if the image has a human or not  

## unsupervised 
    - we donot have a label for the output data  
    - model should cluster the data by itself and find the pattern 
    - ex:
        - anomaly finding
